# Project Title: Comprehensive Documentation on Code Version Management
The Code Version Documentation project aims to create comprehensive documentation for version control processes, release management, and change logs for all repositories under HWAI products/projects. This documentation will help developers and stakeholders understand the versioning strategy, track changes, naming convention and ensure consistency across all projects of HWAI.

Effective naming conventions enhance clarity, reduce misunderstandings, and ensure consistency across projects. Here are the naming best practices and rules for various elements in your organization, with examples for Plan Comparison.

1. General Rules
Clarity: Names should clearly convey the purpose or function.
Consistency: Use the same naming style throughout the project.
Descriptive: Include enough detail to understand the context without being overly verbose.
Avoid Abbreviations: Use full words unless abbreviations are widely recognized and consistently used.
2. Project Names
Format: ProjectName
Example: PlanComparison
3. Repository Names
Format: project-name
Example: plan-comparison
4. Branch Names
