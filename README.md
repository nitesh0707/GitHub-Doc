# Project Title: Comprehensive Documentation on Code Version Management
The Code Version Documentation project aims to create comprehensive documentation for version control processes, release management, and change logs for all repositories under HWAI products/projects. This documentation will help developers and stakeholders understand the versioning strategy, track changes, naming convention and ensure consistency across all projects of HWAI.

# Project Title: Comprehensive Documentation on Code Version Management
The Code Version Documentation project aims to create comprehensive documentation for version control processes, release management, and change logs for all repositories under HWAI products/projects. This documentation will help developers and stakeholders understand the versioning strategy, track changes, naming convention and ensure consistency across all projects of HWAI.

Version control processes used at HWAI, providing guidelines for managing code changes, ensuring consistency, and facilitating collaboration across all project
1. Version Control System
Tool: Git
Hosting: GitHub (or other Git-based platforms as applicable)

2. Branching Strategy
Main Branches:
main: Stable branch representing the production-ready code.
UAT: 
dev: Integration branch for features before merging into main.

Supporting Branches:
creating new branches should be restricted to developing feature only, not for bug fix
example : userName/(taskId from Clickup)CU-86cvfr9p6/(Task name from clickup)Enrollment-Chart-Api

3. Commit Guidelines

Commit often, with small and focused changes.
Use descriptive messages that explain the purpose of the change.
Reference issue IDs(Clickup Id) in commit messages when applicable.

4. Pull Request Process
Taking a pull from the main branch ...

5. Tagging and Releasing
Versioning: Use Semantic Versioning (vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

MAJOR: Incompatible API changes
MINOR: Backward-compatible functionality
PATCH: Backward-compatible bug fixes
Tagging: Tag the release branch or main branch with the version number.

Example:

v1.0.0
Release Process:

Merge changes from develop into release/version.
Test the release branch thoroughly.
Merge the release branch into main.
Tag the main branch with the release version.
Deploy the release to production.

6. Change Log Maintenance
Purpose: To document all changes (features, fixes, improvements) made in each release.
Format:
Added: New features
Fixed: Bug fixes
Changed: Updates or modifications
Deprecated: Features to be removed in future releases
Removed: Features removed in this release

7. Automated Processes
CI/CD Integration: Ensure all branches are integrated with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
Pre-commit Hooks: Use pre-commit hooks to enforce coding standards and run tests before commits.

8. Documentation Updates
Best Practice: Update related documentation (e.g., README, API docs) whenever significant changes are made to the codebase.
Commit Messages: Use the docs type in commit messages for documentation changes.



Effective naming conventions enhance clarity, reduce misunderstandings, and ensure consistency across projects. Here are the naming best practices and rules for various elements in your organization, with examples for Plan Comparison.

1. General Rules
Clarity: Names should clearly convey the purpose or function.
Consistency: Use the same naming style throughout the project.
Descriptive: Include enough detail to understand the context without being overly verbose.
Avoid Abbreviations: Use full words unless abbreviations are widely recognized and consistently used.

2. Org Names
Format: OrgName
Example: ProductIntel

3. Repository Names
Format: project-name
Example: plan-comparison
