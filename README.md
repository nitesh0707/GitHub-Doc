# Project Title: Comprehensive Documentation on Code Version Management
The Code Version Documentation project aims to create comprehensive documentation for version control processes, release management, and change logs for all repositories under HWAI products/projects. This documentation will help developers and stakeholders understand the versioning strategy, track changes, naming convention and ensure consistency across all projects of HWAI.

Version control processes used at HWAI, providing guidelines for managing code changes, ensuring consistency, and facilitating collaboration across all project
1. Version Control System
Tool: Git
Hosting: GitHub (or other Git-based platforms as applicable)

2. Branching Strategy
Main Branches:
main: Stable branch representing the production-ready code.
develop: Integration branch for features before merging into main.

Supporting Branches:
feature/description: For developing new features.
bugfix/description: For fixing bugs.
hotfix/description: For urgent fixes that need to be applied to the main branch.
release/version: For preparing a new production release.
Example:

feature/add-plan-comparison
bugfix/fix-plan-loading-error
hotfix/security-patch
release/v1.0.0

3. Commit Guidelines
Commit Message Format: [Type] Description
Types: feat, fix, chore, docs, style, refactor, test
Example:

[feat] Add plan comparison feature
[fix] Correct loading error in plan comparison
Best Practices:

Commit often, with small and focused changes.
Use descriptive messages that explain the purpose of the change.
Reference issue IDs in commit messages when applicable.

4. Pull Request Process
Branching: Create a branch from develop for features or main for hotfixes.
Review: Submit a pull request (PR) when the branch is ready for review.
Reviewers: At least one other team member should review the PR.
Approval: After review and approval, the branch can be merged into the target branch (develop or main).
Merge: Use "Squash and merge" to create a clean history or "Rebase and merge" for a linear history.
Best Practices:

Ensure the PR description clearly explains the changes.
Reference related issues or tasks in the PR.
Address all comments and suggestions from reviewers before merging.

5. Tagging and Releasing
Versioning: Use Semantic Versioning (vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

MAJOR: Incompatible API changes
MINOR: Backward-compatible functionality
PATCH: Backward-compatible bug fixes
Tagging: Tag the release branch or main branch with the version number.

Example:

v1.0.0
Release Process:

Merge changes from develop into release/version.
Test the release branch thoroughly.
Merge the release branch into main.
Tag the main branch with the release version.
Deploy the release to production.

6. Change Log Maintenance
Purpose: To document all changes (features, fixes, improvements) made in each release.
Format:
Added: New features
Fixed: Bug fixes
Changed: Updates or modifications
Deprecated: Features to be removed in future releases
Removed: Features removed in this release

7. Automated Processes
CI/CD Integration: Ensure all branches are integrated with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
Pre-commit Hooks: Use pre-commit hooks to enforce coding standards and run tests before commits.

8. Documentation Updates
Best Practice: Update related documentation (e.g., README, API docs) whenever significant changes are made to the codebase.
Commit Messages: Use the docs type in commit messages for documentation changes.



Effective naming conventions enhance clarity, reduce misunderstandings, and ensure consistency across projects. Here are the naming best practices and rules for various elements in your organization, with examples for Plan Comparison.

1. General Rules
Clarity: Names should clearly convey the purpose or function.
Consistency: Use the same naming style throughout the project.
Descriptive: Include enough detail to understand the context without being overly verbose.
Avoid Abbreviations: Use full words unless abbreviations are widely recognized and consistently used.

2. Project Names
Format: ProjectName
Example: PlanComparison

3. Repository Names
Format: project-name
Example: plan-comparison

4. Branch Names
Format: feature/description, bugfix/description, hotfix/description, release/version
Example:
feature/add-new-plan-comparison
bugfix/fix-plan-loading-error
hotfix/urgent-security-patch
release/v1.0.0

5. Tag Names
Format: vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
Example: v1.0.0

6. Commit Messages
Format: [Type] Description
Types: feat (feature), fix (bug fix), chore (maintenance), docs (documentation), style (formatting), refactor (code changes without feature/bug), test (adding/modifying tests)
Example:
[feat] Add comparison feature for plans
[fix] Resolve issue with plan comparison loading

7. File and Directory Names
Format: kebab-case (lowercase words separated by hyphens)
Example:
plan-comparison-service.js
plan-comparison-controller.py

8. Class Names
Format: PascalCase
Example: PlanComparisonService

9. Variable Names
Format: camelCase
Example: planComparisonResult

10. Constant Names
Format: UPPER_CASE
Example: MAX_PLAN_LIMIT

11. Database Table Names
Format: snake_case
Example: plan_comparison

12. Column Names
Format: snake_case
Example: plan_id, comparison_result

13. API Endpoint Names
Format: kebab-case
Example:
GET /api/v1/plan-comparison
POST /api/v1/plan-comparison

14. Configuration Files
Format: kebab-case
Example:
plan-comparison-config.json
plan-comparison-settings.yml

15. Environment Variables
Format: UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
Example: PLAN_COMPARISON_API_URL
